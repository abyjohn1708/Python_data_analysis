Data Analysis
Top 10 Countries with the Highest Total COVID-19 Cases
We started by identifying the countries with the highest total COVID-19 cases and visualized them in a bar chart:

## Top 10 Countries with the Highest Total Cases

### Mortality Rate vs. Recovery Rate for Top 10 Countries
We analyzed the relationship between mortality rate and recovery rate for the top 10 countries with the highest total cases. Each country is represented by a point on the scatterplot:

### Mortality Rate vs. Recovery Rate

Total Deaths vs. Total Recovered for Top 10 Countries
We compared the total deaths to total recoveries for the top 10 countries:

Total Deaths vs. Total Recovered

## Conclusion
This analysis provided insights into the COVID-19 situation in different countries, highlighting the top countries with the highest total cases and comparing mortality and recovery rates. Further analysis and insights can be gained by exploring the dataset in more depth.
